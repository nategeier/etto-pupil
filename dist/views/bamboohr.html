          <h4>Divisions and Departments</h4>
          <p>Before connecting to Coursetto, it is incredibly helpful to slot employees in Divisions and Departments correctly. A big part of Coursetto is the ability to create courses for particular division or departments individually. Marketers can take marketing courses and engineers can take engineering courses.</p>
          <p>Divisions and Branches will populate with users from your company's BambooHR account. An email invite will be sent to any active employees who are not already in Coursetto.</p>

          <h4>Pressing Sync to BambooHR</h4>
          <p>Users who are not already in Coursetto will be sent an email invite and will have the set authorization. Please check the appropriate boxes for all new invites to be authorized to do as you wish.</p>
          <h3>Authorization</h3><img src="/images/site/auth.png" class="img-responsive"/>
          <p>By default all authorization is turned off, which means all new invites will not be able to do anything in Coursetto but take the courses designated to them. If you trust your employees enough, empower them to do more.</p>
          <p>You can edit users authorization individually in their profile page after you sync to allow users to do things like edit courses.</p>
